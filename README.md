# Personal Project :: K-Means Algorithm
Project developed in order to create an algorithm to help on the processing of Data Mining over a Data Set, included at the project. The idea was to extract metrics to use as input to visualization.

#### Project Information
- Project: ``K-Means Algorithm``
&nbsp;

- Objective: ``Personal``
&nbsp;

- Status: ``Completed``
&nbsp;

- Technology: ``Java``
&nbsp;

- Date: ``Nov 2015``
&nbsp;

## Project Detailing
### Details
The K-Means algorithm works in the following way:

- First, it's needed to specify how many clusters K you will have
- Shuffle the data you want to use, and define K data points. This way, you are initiating the centroids
- Iterate over the data until there's no change on centroids.
- Take the distance between every centroid and datapoints, square it and sum
- Take the average of all datapoints, for each cluster

This code generates two results: the Iris and Yeast Gene. It simulates the use of Clusters, in order to analyze the data.
